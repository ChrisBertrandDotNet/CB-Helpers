This project serves a unique purpose: listing all documentation in Visual Studio.

This way, I can edit the markdown files directly in the IDE, thanks to this extension: [Markdown Editor](https://github.com/madskristensen/MarkdownEditor).

PS: I did not create a shared project since this kind of project can not contain reference to files: they copy them to the project's directory. At least on VS 2017.
